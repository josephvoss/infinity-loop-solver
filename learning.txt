First import image and convert it to gray scale. Verify correct grayscale done

Set threshold to middle of grayscale, then binary to black and white image
ERROR - kfmIkJC is past grayscale line. Solves by increasing grayscale past 127, 
but inconsistent solution. Swoosh adaptive threashold

Is this really necessary? lowering threashold to 200 works fine
	Eh, good exercise
	Mean looks better than gaussian, but jpgs quality is definity causing artificats
	NB: Adaptive threshold is when the image isn't at a constant lighting. Not an issue here, if image is pulled from VM. If image pulled from camera it will be though. Set adaptive mean, and explain

	CONVERSLY, try otsu's thresholding - with gaussian filtering. Look into for actual image. Would do several samples of available colors to find the max threashold point
	Gaussian filter removed JPEG issue. Therefore, filtering of image should be
		Black and white
		Gaussian
		Otsus OR adaptive
			Thinking adaptive will be better but idk now

Template finding
    Need to update for scale invariant
    Current method is from tutorial but doesn't provide correct identifiers
    No, rework to dead simple trick - brute forcing over range of scales
   
    Rework in prog
